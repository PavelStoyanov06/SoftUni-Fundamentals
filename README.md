# SoftUni-Fundamentals
This is a repo for uploding all my files from the softuni fundamentals course!

Every program from the Fundamentals course of SoftUni will be included here, no matter the size.
Beware that this repo is mainly for testing purpouses!

Available now:
1. Basic Syntax
2. Data Types and Variables
3. Arrays

In case you are wondering where the folder with files is - look no further than the Solutions folder!
#Added a snippets folder if I happen to make any!
